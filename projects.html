        <p>With microscopy, I was able to apply the knowledge I learned, in science, about cellular and microbiology to refine my
            understanding of the objective and it helped me identify parts of cell structure such as the mitochondria and cell membrane
            using my microscope. I also applied what I learning in math about optics and the reflection of light, the use of convex and
            concave lenses, and calculating the focus of light to better create a strong and sophisticated microscope. In engineering,
            using the engineering design process, I was better able to organize the iteration and advancement of my group's project.
