        <p>In 9th grade STEM, the grand theme was food. My cohort was tasked with creating the both efficient and sustainable 
            solutions for a given problem relating to agriculture or biology. There were 3 projects that helped me demonstrate my understanding
            of topics that I learned in the classroom. Those projects were: <br><br>

    <div class="word-content">
        <p>For the microscopy project, my group was tasked with creating a sustainable and portable microscope to help with disease
            diagnosis in underserved communities worldwide. With microscopy, I was able to apply the knowledge I learned, in biology,
            about cellular and microbiology to refine my understanding of the objective and it helped me identify parts of cell
            structure such as the mitochondria and cell membrane using my microscope. I also applied what I learning in math about
            optics and the reflection of light, the use of convex and concave lenses, and calculating the focus of light to better
            create a strong and sophisticated microscope. In engineering, using the engineering design process, I was better able 
            to organize the iteration and advancement of my group's project. Additionally, using precise handheld tools, I was able
            to build a microscope with accurate dimensions that reflected the vision my group had in mind.<br><br>

    <div class="word-content">
        <p>Food production was the "core" project for this year as it incorporated almost all of the subjects I learned in the classroom.
            My group was tasked with making a sustainable method of growing a crop and we chose potatoes. We made a cold frame as, in the
            winter, temperatures are not ideal for growing potatoes in Northern Virginia. We applied the knowledge we learned to create a
            cold frame that would keep the potatoes warm enough to grow. In biology, I learned about Mendelian genetics and topics in
            sustainable agriculture such as organic farming, sustainable
            alternatives to preexisting farming methods, and agriculturally sustainable best practices. This helped my group to make
            informed decisions on: what materials we would use, how we would execute the project, and the goals and scope of our project.
            In math, I learned about data analysis and how to extrapolate our team's data that we collected. This introduction to data
            analysis helped my team assess our cold frame's effectiveness.<br><br>

    <div class="word-content">
        <p>Bio-inspired design was a project that dealt with creating awareness and a home for 1 of 3 animals: the Purple Martin, bees, or bats. My
            group ultimately decided on the Purple Martin. We created a bird house to create a structure for them to create their nest
            in. In biology, I learned about about symbiotic relationships and ecology which helped my group create criteria and constraints
            for our design. In math, I learned about angles, polygons, and similar triangles. We used angles and regular polygons actively
            in our iterations and our final design had many aspects that incorporated them. We used similar triangles conceptually to be
            able to scale our project down from its real dimensions to a scale model. In engineering, we researched bird house designs,
            the Purple Martin's predators, and specific dimensions that Purple Martin required. This helped guide us through design creation
            as we iterated.<br><br>

        <p>In 10th grade STEM, the grand theme was water. My cohort was tasked with creating the both efficient and sustainable 
            solutions for a given problem relating to access to clean water, worldwide awareness of acidifying oceans, and analysis of
            polluted water. There were 3 projects that helped me demonstrate my understanding

        <p>For water purification, my group was tasked with creating a water filter for a location that does not have access to clean
            water. My group chose Varanasi, India. The filter was to be composed of common materials, such as a 2 liter bottle, rocks,
            sand, etc. My group created a multi-stage filter that even took some chemicals out of the water. We applied what we
            learned in chemistry about safety limits for different water quality parameters and how to achieve them into our filter.
            We used charcoal in an attempt to achieve this. In math, we applied our newfound Excel skills and data communication skills
            to determine how much our iterations were improving by and how close we were to our desired water quality. In engineering,
            we learned different sketching and design techiques to communicate our designs to our team before commiting resources to a
            design. This ultimately proved useful as there were many small calculations involved in an iteration, which added up, would
            have taken double the time if we tried every design.<br><br>
