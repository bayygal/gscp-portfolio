        <p>Going into my 12th grade year, I'm going to be taking the hardest courseload I've ever attempted. These classes can be seen below.</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><p>IB Math Analysis & Applications HL 2</p></li>
            <li><p>IB Physics HL 2</p></li>
            <li><p>AP Statistics (through the online campus)</p></li>
            <li><p>IB Computer Science SL</p></li>
            <li><p>IB Language & Literature HL 2</p></li>
            <li><p>IB History of the Americas HL 2</p></li>
            <li><p>Cyber: Oracle 1</p></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>I'll be taking IB Math Analysis HL and AP Stats to prepare myself for my future college courseload. Multivariable calculus,
        linear algebra, and lots of data science will be in my future so its necessary to take them. Additionally, I'm taking IB CS and Oracle
        to prepare myself for my major specific classes. <br> <br>
        
        On the extracurricular side, I'm planning to be vice-president of Photography Club, a student leader of the Technology Student Association
        at Edison, and plan to compete in Future Business Leaders of America. I'm planning on continuing my Flight Commander role in Civil Air Patrol.
        In addition, I'm planning to be a aerospace, cyber, and leadership support officer.</p>
