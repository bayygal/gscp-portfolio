        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Randy! <br> <br>

            I'm a student at Thomas A. Edison High School with an interest in Computer Engineering and more specifically, AI/ML Engineering. Growing up, I thought that I was going to be an astronaut, then a "businessman" (entrepreneur), then an engineer.
            My overarching career goal has always been to change the world but through the scope of space exploration. I chose AI engineering because after seeing what the wonders of space have done for me, I want to help others see it too.
            I want to eventually integrate AI and ML into aircraft and spacecraft to make space travel more accessible and affordable. <br><br>

            As for things outside of my career and academics, I'm also a photographer and videographer. My photography portfolio can be found here.</p>
